# Solo_Project

This project is about building a web application where a user can go to build it's own workout routines.
In order to create workout routines the user will need to add some movements/esercises to the site to then use them to buil a complete workout routine.

The woourkout routine will be then created by adding different movements which can be measured by reps or time.

Once the workout is created the user will be able to go to the main page and add a workout for each day of the week.
